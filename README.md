## About

3D Pong Game is implemented using OpenGL and C++. It features a 3D environment with lighting effects and allows two players to compete against each other.

## Features

- **3D Graphics**: Utilizes OpenGL for rendering 3D graphics.
- **Two-player Mode**: Control paddles using keyboard inputs.
- **Lighting Effects**: Toggle lighting for enhanced visuals.
- **Camera Controls**: Adjust camera angle and distance.
